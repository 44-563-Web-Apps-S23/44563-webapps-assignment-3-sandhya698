    <p>
        When cricket's on, everything comes to a <b>standstill</b>.
        <br>
        No matter how important an exam or meeting one has on the next day, the Indian cricket fan takes the time out to keep tabs on his favourite team's match.
        <br>
        It seems even more challenging for an entire team to work towards the same goal, complement each others' strengths and weaknesses and share the woes and throes of <b>defeat and victory</b>.
